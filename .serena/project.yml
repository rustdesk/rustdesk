# Note:
#   - For C, use cpp
#   - For JavaScript, use typescript
# Special requirements:
#   - csharp: Requires the presence of a .sln file in the project folder.
# When using multiple languages, the first language server that supports a given file will be used for that file.
# The first language is the default language and the respective language server will be used as a fallback.
# Note that when using the JetBrains backend, language servers are not used and this list is correspondingly ignored.

#
#  * `activate_project`: Activates a project by name.
#  * `check_onboarding_performed`: Checks whether project onboarding was already performed.
#  * `create_text_file`: Creates/overwrites a file in the project directory.
#  * `delete_lines`: Deletes a range of lines within a file.
#  * `delete_memory`: Deletes a memory from Serena's project-specific memory store.
#  * `execute_shell_command`: Executes a shell command.
#  * `find_referencing_code_snippets`: Finds code snippets in which the symbol at the given location is referenced.
#  * `find_referencing_symbols`: Finds symbols that reference the symbol at the given location (optionally filtered by type).
#  * `find_symbol`: Performs a global (or local) search for symbols with/containing a given name/substring (optionally filtered by type).
#  * `get_current_config`: Prints the current configuration of the agent, including the active and available projects, tools, contexts, and modes.
#  * `get_symbols_overview`: Gets an overview of the top-level symbols defined in a given file.
#  * `initial_instructions`: Gets the initial instructions for the current project.
#     Should only be used in settings where the system prompt cannot be set,
#     e.g. in clients you have no control over, like Claude Desktop.
#  * `insert_after_symbol`: Inserts content after the end of the definition of a given symbol.
#  * `insert_at_line`: Inserts content at a given line in a file.
#  * `insert_before_symbol`: Inserts content before the beginning of the definition of a given symbol.
#  * `list_dir`: Lists files and directories in the given directory (optionally with recursion).
#  * `list_memories`: Lists memories in Serena's project-specific memory store.
#  * `onboarding`: Performs onboarding (identifying the project structure and essential tasks, e.g. for testing or building).
#  * `prepare_for_new_conversation`: Provides instructions for preparing for a new conversation (in order to continue with the necessary context).
#  * `read_file`: Reads a file within the project directory.
#  * `read_memory`: Reads the memory with the given name from Serena's project-specific memory store.
#  * `remove_project`: Removes a project from the Serena configuration.
#  * `replace_lines`: Replaces a range of lines within a file with new content.
#  * `replace_symbol_body`: Replaces the full definition of a symbol.
#  * `restart_language_server`: Restarts the language server, may be necessary when edits not through Serena happen.
#  * `search_for_pattern`: Performs a search for a pattern in the project.
#  * `summarize_changes`: Provides instructions for summarizing the changes made to the codebase.
#  * `switch_modes`: Activates modes by providing a list of their names
#  * `think_about_collected_information`: Thinking tool for pondering the completeness of collected information.
#  * `think_about_task_adherence`: Thinking tool for determining whether the agent is still on track with the current task.
#  * `think_about_whether_you_are_done`: Thinking tool for determining whether the task is truly completed.
#  * `write_memory`: Writes a named memory (for future reference) to Serena's project-specific memory store.
